## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Admin authentication

Authentication uses a MySQL-backed opaque session cookie. All API routes are
protected by default; `POST /auth/sign-in` is the public sign-in route.

1. Keep your existing `.env` and add `PORT=3001`,
   `FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000`, an `ADMIN_EMAIL`, and an
   `ADMIN_PASSWORD` of at least 12 characters. If you do not have a `.env`
   file yet, copy `.env.example` and fill in the MySQL connection values too.
2. Apply the Prisma migrations and regenerate the client:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. Seed the configured administrator:

   ```bash
   npm run seed:admin
   ```

   This creates the admin if the email does not exist. If the account already
   exists as a customer, it is promoted to admin without changing its password.
   The command is safe to rerun.
4. Start the API with `npm run start:dev`. The same configured administrator is
   also ensured at startup.
5. Configure `frontend/.env.local` with
   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001` and start the frontend.

The API exposes `POST /auth/sign-in`, `GET /auth/me`, and
`POST /auth/sign-out`. The session cookie is HttpOnly and is not returned as a
JavaScript-readable token.

Only browser sessions are persisted in MySQL for this local admin flow. Before
deploying with `NODE_ENV=production`, add persistent stores for the
authentication package's refresh-token and MFA contracts (the package rejects
in-memory stores in production) and configure login rate limiting.

## Project setup

$ npm run test

# e2e tests
$ npm run test:e2e

# test coverage
$ npm run test:cov
```

## Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your NestJS application to production, there are some key steps you can take to ensure it runs as efficiently as possible. Check out the [deployment documentation](https://docs.nestjs.com/deployment) for more information.

If you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out [Mau](https://mau.nestjs.com), our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:

```bash
$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau
$ mau deploy
```

With Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.

## Observability

In production applications, observability is essential for understanding how your system behaves, detecting issues early, and maintaining reliable performance.

[NestJS Observe](https://observe.nestjs.com) automatically instruments your NestJS application, giving you deep visibility into your system with minimal setup:

- **Distributed tracing:** Follow requests across services and understand how they flow through your system.
- **Waterfall analysis:** Visualize request execution and identify slow operations, bottlenecks, and unexpected delays.
- **Performance analysis:** Analyze application performance in real time and quickly pinpoint areas that need optimization.
- **Metrics:** Track key application and infrastructure metrics to understand system health and performance trends.
- **Logging:** Centralize and correlate logs with traces and other telemetry to make debugging easier.
- **Error tracking:** Detect errors quickly and investigate their root causes with the surrounding context.
- **SLA monitoring:** Track service-level objectives and identify when your application is approaching or exceeding defined thresholds.
- **Alarms and alerts:** Set up alerts for critical errors, performance degradation, SLA violations, and other anomalies so your team can react quickly.
